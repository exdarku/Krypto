## FAQs

	 - Krypto was created as an alternative to account managers such as LastPass, and Bitwarden. Mainly, I wanted to use BitWarden, but the need to pay for its 2FA threw me off, thus, I created Krypto.

	- Krypto  is created with security at mind. All data are encrypted with AES 256, and is also hashed with SHA256

	- You don't need to use Krypto, but you can always contribute, and make the program better.

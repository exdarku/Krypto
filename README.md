# Krypto
**Krypto** is an open source account manager created with Python, Firebase, and PyQt5. 

*Krypto was recently showcased at **Drop That Firebase - A Firebase Workshop.***

## FAQs

 - **Why was Krypto created?**
	 - Krypto was developed as a viable alternative to popular account managers like LastPass and Bitwarden. As a student, I personally wanted to use Bitwarden, but the requirement to pay for its 2FA feature discouraged me. Consequently, I embarked on creating Krypto to address this need.
- **Is Krypto secure?**
	- Krypto has been designed with security as the top priority. All data is protected using robust encryption standards, utilizing AES 256. Additionally, sensitive information is further safeguarded through the application of SHA256 hashing.
- **Why should I use Krypto?**
	- While the decision to use Krypto is entirely up to you, I encourage you to contribute to its development and help make it even better. Your valuable contributions can significantly enhance the program and benefit the entire community.
